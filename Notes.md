#Notes
Things to think about when developing 
* organisation, efficiency, methods for remembering ideas and thoughts for creating, analysing and solving problems
#Abstraction Methods
How I simplify the project down to understandable problems that can be solved. Making problems simpler
- 
#Decomposition Methods
How I break down complicated problems into sections to be completed and how I plan for the problem to be solved and used in different context

#Features

#Project Habits to follow
- When writing code and solving different problems think about how that solution can then be 
used in other parts of the application
- Keep planning and thinking before writing code figure out the steps of creating a solution
and figure out the steps of using that solution afterwards
- Each problem will have problems connected to it - ESPECIALLY IN THE DATABASE 
- database will require a lot of key connections so I have to plan how the different data sets will connect
# Habits for bug testing code

#Abilities to develop
- ability to spend long periods of time on a single problem looking at different solutions
- focus on developing a extensive map of the different problems and solutions for organisation and efficiency
